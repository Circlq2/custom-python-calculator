# Custom-Python-Calculator

The target auidence is adults.

There are different colours for each type of button:
1. Normal numbers are plain white.
2. Operations(+, -, *, /) are purple as a stand out from other colours.
3.  . and = are yellow and also is standing out from the other operations that you use to but inbetween two numbers.
4. Clear button is light pink because it is meant to stand out from the rest as it clears the equation.

I have made the backround a nice light blue to give it a bit of colour but not make it to in your face.
The label that holds the equations is turquoize to stand out from the buttons but does not stand out much from the backround.
